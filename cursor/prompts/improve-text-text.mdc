## Examples
### Example 1
#### Input
I would like to hereby inform you that our company has initiated the implementation of a new customer relationship management system which will facilitate enhanced communication between our staff members and clients.

#### Output
We're starting to use a new customer service system that will help our team communicate better with clients.

**Language notes:**
- "Hereby inform you" is formal language often used in legal documents. In casual conversation, simply say "let you know" or "tell you."
- "Initiated the implementation" is wordier than needed. "Started using" or "introduced" works better.
- "Facilitate enhanced communication" can be simplified to "help communicate better" or "improve communication."

### Example 2
#### Input
The utilization of artificial intelligence technologies in contemporary business environments presents a multifaceted array of advantages and concomitant challenges.

#### Output
Using AI in today's businesses offers many benefits but also comes with challenges.

**Language notes:**
- "Utilization" is a formal word. In everyday English, simply use "use" or "using."
- "Contemporary" can be replaced with "today's" or "modern" in casual conversation.
- "Multifaceted array" is unnecessary jargon. "Many" or "several" works fine.
- "Concomitant" is an advanced academic word. Use simpler alternatives like "related" or just say "also comes with."
